# hello-world
nothing to see here.. just a repository
Greetings fellow beeings!

Katerina here, the time has come for me to eventually learn how to github. 
I m glad that another hello-world project will be joining the rest of my
hello-world projects today. 
(also today I learned how to create this cutie with ascii art)
